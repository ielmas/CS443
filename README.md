# CS443 – Cloud Computing &amp; (Mobile) Applications

## Catalog Description
Hands-on introduction to cloud computing and developing cloud-native (esp. mobile) applications. Cloud application models, services and infrastructures (virtualization, data center networking, distributed file systems), cluster computing systems (e.g. Spark), fundamental trade offs and methods (CAP theorem, NoSQL systems), architecture (modern n-tier, lambda, kappa) and applications (big data analytics, large-scale web services). Programming to develop scalable applications running on the cloud (e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle).

Basically, this course has the following learning outcomes:
* What is cloud computing? Why we need it and in which cases we can use that paradigm (__Module-1: What is it?__).
* How to implement a cloud computing system? What is essential to build an efficient cloud solution (__Module-2: How to implement it?__)
* How to sustain a cloud application in both business and technical terms (__Module-3: How to manage it?__)

## Project
Each student is expected to be part of a team (size of 3 people). During the fifth or sixth week of classes the project topic will be announced and every team will be expected to implement a cloud-native mobile-first application. Grading criteria will include the operational features of the application (we will cover these features in detail throughout the semester). During the classes each team will present: reports and demo/presentation on at least but not limited to the implementation details, external services, cloud characteristics, performance analysis, etc.

## FAQ
Below you can find the questions received during the first week of classes (hoping that will help you to decide on taking the course before add/drop week)

__Q1:__ Which mobile development frameworks (iOS/Android/etc.) will be used during the course? <br/>
__A1:__ Please do not consider that course as a "App development course". "Mobile App development" is not one of the learning outcome objectives. We will use "mobile applications" as the main theme for implementing a cloud computing solution.

__Q2:__ Which cloud service provider (vendor) will be used during the course (tutorials and/or project)? <br/>
__A2:__ Any tool/framework of a major vendor can be used (please refer to "catalog desc." part). Project deliverables (reports/presentation/demo/etc.) will include details about external services used (but it has no effect on grading). In terms of our learning objectives, we will be more into "how you use these services/tools under which conditions".

__Q3:__ Do you consider to use spare hour of the course (Wed. 16:40)? <br/>
__A3:__ Not by default. Normally, we will not use the spare slot regularly but it will be used to make up any missed class hour. A notice mail will be sent to all registered students via STARS system in any such cases (as early as possible).

__Q4:__ Are you planning to use any textbook? <br />
__A4:__ No, it is very difficult to find a book that covers the topics of that course. The main objective is to design a course that conveys the both technical and business sides of cloud systems. Therefore, following this web page for slides (I will upload slides weekly) and "external links" list (probably that list will include additional infomative content which is referred in the course but not limited to that) is the best way to cope with it.

__Q5:__ Is it possible to form a 5-person project team? <br />
__A5:__ No, it is not possible.
