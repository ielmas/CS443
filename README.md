# CS443 â€“ Cloud Computing &amp; Applications

## Catalog Description
Hands-on introduction to cloud computing and developing cloud-native applications. Cloud application models, services and infrastructures (virtualization, data center networking, distributed file systems), cluster computing systems (e.g. Spark), fundemantal tradeoffs and methods (CAP theorem, NoSQL systems), arhictecture (modern n-tier, lambda, kappa) and applications (big data analytics, large-scale web services). Programming to develop scalable applications running on the cloud (e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle).

## Project
Each student is expected to be part of a team (size of 2 or 3 people). During the fifth or sixth week of classes the project topic will be annnounced and every team will be expected to implement a cloud-native mobile-first application. Grading criteria will include the operational features of the application (we will cover these features in detail). During the classes each team will present: reports and demo/presentation on at least but not limited to the implementation details, external services, cloud characteristics, performance analysis, etc.
